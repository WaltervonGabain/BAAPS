## FAQ

- **Error: The network id specified in the truffle config (XXXXXXX) does not match the one returned by the network (YYYYYYY). Ensure that both the network and the provider are properly configured.**

  Paste YYYYYY here in the truffle-config.js (line 52) -> network_id: "XXXXXXX"

- **How do I use this with Ganache (or any other network)?**

  The Truffle project is set to deploy to Ganache by default. If you'd like to change this, it's as easy as modifying the Truffle config file! Check out [our documentation on adding network configurations](https://trufflesuite.com/docs/truffle/reference/configuration/#networks). From there, you can run `truffle migrate` pointed to another network, restart the React dev server, and see the change take place.

- **Where can I find more resources?**

  This Box is a sweet combo of [Truffle](https://trufflesuite.com) and [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org). Either one would be a great place to start!
